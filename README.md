# Intelligent-Hotel-ROS-based-Service-Robot
## Abstract—With the advances of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, many studies and work have been carried out on how robots could replace human labor. Based on the conventional surveys, this paper presents a conceive on the intelligence hotel robot, which simplify the check-in process. Also considered in different environment settings, robot can self-adaption with the different cases. Combined with Hokuyo Lidar and Kinect Xbox camera, the robot can plan the routes accurately, besides it can reach to different floors. Focus on the analysis of the numbers on the elevator’s wall, we assume that robot has the ability to read the numbers and symbols, then press the corresponding button. What is more, the intelligent voice system provides an assistant for the customers. Furthermore, the intelligent order sending system provides fully-automatic food delivery. However, the hotel not only divides human work, but also reconstructs it from tasks. Moreover, the purpose of reconstruction is not simply for replacement of works. Such modification of a task is often observed taking place in human- system interactions. It is an extremely productive process of labor emerging in this area.
